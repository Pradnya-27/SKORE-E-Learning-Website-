        <h2 class="mb-4">Introduction to Java</h2>
        <p><h5>JAVA</h5> was created by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems Inc in the year 1995, later procured by Prophet Company. It is a basic programming language. Java makes composing, ordering, and troubleshooting programming simple. It assists with making reusable code and measured programs. Java is a class-based, object-situated programming language and is intended to have as hardly any execution conditions as could really be expected. A universally useful programming language made for engineers to compose once run anyplace that is ordered Java code can run on all stages that help Java. Java applications are accumulated to byte code that can run on any Java Virtual Machine. The grammar of Java is like c/c++.</p>
        <p><h5>History:</h5> Java's set of experiences is exceptionally intriguing. It is a programming language made in 1991. James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton, a group of Sun engineers known as the Green group started the Java language in 1991. Sun Microsystems delivered its most memorable public execution in 1996 as Java 1.0. It gives no-cost - run-times on well known stages. Java1.0 compiler was re-written in Java by Arthur Van Hoff to conform to its details stringently. With the appearance of Java 2, new variants had various arrangements worked for various sorts of stages.</p>
        <p>
            In 1997, Sun Microsystems moved toward the ISO principles body and later formalized Java, yet it before long pulled out from the cycle. At one time, Sun made the majority of its Java executions accessible without charge, regardless of their restrictive programming status. Sun created income from Java through the selling of licenses for specific items like the Java Venture Framework.
        </p>
        <p>
            On November 13, 2006, Sun delivered a lot of its Java virtual machine as free, open-source programming. On May 8, 2007, Sun completed the cycle, making its JVM's all's center code accessible under open-source appropriation terms.

        <h2 class="mb-4">Java Programming Language</h2>
        <p>
            Java is one of the most popular and widely used programming languages.

Java has been one of the most popular programming languages for many years.
Java is Object Oriented. However, it is not considered as pure object-oriented as it provides support for primitive data types (like int, char, etc)
The Java codes are first compiled into byte code (machine-independent code). Then the byte code runs on Java Virtual Machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying architecture.
Java syntax is similar to C/C++. But Java does not provide low-level programming functionalities like pointers. Also, Java codes are always written in the form of classes and objects.
Java is used in all kinds of applications like Mobile Applications (Android is Java-based), desktop applications, web applications, client-server applications, enterprise applications, and many more.
When compared with C++, Java codes are generally more maintainable because Java does not allow many things which may lead to bad/inefficient programming if used incorrectly. For example, non-primitives are always references in Java. So we cannot pass large objects (like we can do in C++) to functions, we always pass references in Java. One more example, since there are no pointers, bad memory access is also not possible.
When compared with Python, Java kind of fits between C++ and Python. The programs are written in Java typically run faster than corresponding Python programs and slower than C++. Like C++, Java does static type checking, but Python does not.
